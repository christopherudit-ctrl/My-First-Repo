A Tutorial Github file, used for getting accquainted with Git, involves creating a local git repository and getting acquainted with the processes on Github.

Steps taken to complete this Tutorial :

Created a local repository and added a simple python file.
Tried using Git Bash to commit and push the file.
Uploaded the file directly to GitHub after running into some push errors.
Added someone as collaborator.
Created a new branch, edited the python file and committed the changes made.
opened a pull request and had the collaborator review it and approve it.
Merged the branch into main and verified Repo is Public for Viewing purposes.

Accidentally deleted the branch cause i didn't read the page properly but provided screenshots the branch did exist in the document to be uploaded.

Note: My original collaborator wasnâ€™t available, so my sister helped review the PR and approve it. She is a student at the University of Guyana as well just not a member of the ITE 1100 class.
